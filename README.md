# Mission-to-Mars
## Purpose:

The purpose of this challenge is to help a junior data analyst to gather data about the Mission to Mars from all over the web and display it in a central location without gathering the data manually. In order to gather data from all over the web, we need to build a web application that will scrape new data everytime we need to with the click of a bottom.

### In this challenge, we did the following:
* Wrote a Python script that can navigate the webpages to collect the right information
* Stored the data in MongoDB
* Used Flask to create a web application using Python and customize it with HTML and CSS
* Used Bootstrap to poslish the web application and make it mobile responsive
