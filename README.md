# Mission-to-Mars
## Purpose:

The purpose of this challenge is to help a junior data analyst to gather data about the Mission to Mars from all over the web and display it in a central location without gathering the data manually. In order to gather data from all over the web, we need to build a web application that will scrape new data everytime we need to with the click of a bottom.

* We will write a Python script that can navigate the webpages to collect the right information; then,
* We will store the data in MongoDB; finally,
* We will use Flask to create a web application using Python and customize it with HTML and CSS; in addition,
* We will use Bootstrap to poslish the web application and make it mobile responsive.
